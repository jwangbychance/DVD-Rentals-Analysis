# DVD-Rentals-Analysis
To analyse the estimated sales, in-demand films for the majority of the customer base, SQL querying was done using PostgreSQL to retrieve specific data from the database. The SQL queries were then imported to Tableau for the visualisation and idenfication of patterns/trends of film genres and sales.
